                <p>Of course we want to make sure that you get an immediate feedback if you exceed the nominal frequency range of your banjo. Especially beginners are sometimes likely to overtune their instrument, trying to find the tone in an adjacent octave.</p>
                 <p>Once you are in a superior octave (for example in the 5th instead of the 4th), you try to tune up and up until the string breaks! That can be really frustrating (and expensive) if such incident occurs multiple times.</p>
                 <p>Let's take a standard banjo (GDGBD tuning) which has a frequency range between 146.8 Hz and 392.0 Hz.<br/>
                 Tuning your instrument, you want to make sure that you stay in this range: Simple Banjo Tuner helps you with blinking arrows (up or down) which appear once you are out of range.
                 </p>
                 <p>Have a look at the screenshot below which represents an example of overtuning: the leftmost G-string of the banjo has nearly 420 Hz, thus 30 Hz above the nominal frequency of 392.0 Hz.

                <p>A beginner may suppose that he has to tune up until the wheel shows G again. But our string protection mechanism is active: a blinking arrow (down) tells him that he has to tune DOWN. Thus his string is protected from breakage!</p>
