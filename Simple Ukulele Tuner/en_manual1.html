                <p>This app comes as a lite version - thus with minimalistic functionalities which enables the user to tune a standard soprano ukulele with a standard (G-C-E-A) tuning.<br/>In order to get additional features, you can upgrade by In-App purchase - see screenshot below: </p>

            <div id="content2" style="clear:both;  padding:0 3.125%;">
                <p>When you call the settings menu for the first time, all features (which are not covered by the lite version) are marked with a shopping cart symbol - it deals both with additional ukulele types, both with additional themes (background colors). Touching one of the eighteen shopping cart symbols, a new menu with three different upgrade options appears:</p>
            </div>
            <div id="screenshot07" style="clear:both;  padding:0 3.125%;">
                <p><center><img src="screenshot_10.png" alt="Screenshot Pro Version" class="img" /></center></p>
            </div>
            <div id="content3" style="clear:both;  padding:0 3.125%;">
                <p>After choosing one of the three upgrade options, you're prompted to sign in completely with your Apple ID and password (if you've never signed in before) OR to enter your password solely:</p>
            </div>
            <div id="screenshot08" style="clear:both;  padding:0 3.125%;">
                <p><center><img src="screenshot_11.png" alt="Screenshot Pro Version" class="img" /></center></p>
            </div>
            <div id="content4" style="clear:both;  padding:0 3.125%;">
                <p>Now you have to confirm the In-App Purchase: when the transaction is completed succesfully, you get an acknowledgement and you're redirected back to the settings menu. All additional features (which are included in the In-App purchase) are unlocked immediately without having to restart the App. In addition, the banner ad is removed permanently and independently of the purchase option! </p>
            </div>
            <div id="screenshot09" style="clear:both;  padding:0 3.125%;">
                <p><center><img src="screenshot_12.png" alt="Screenshot Pro Version" class="img" /></center></p>

                <h2>Combination of In-App Purchases</h2>
                <p>As mentioned before, you've three different options. Please take into account that the first option <strong>All In One</strong> is a combination of the second <strong>All Ukulele</strong> and the third <strong>Signal Plus</strong> option. In the case that you've chosen the second or the third option, you won't be able to buy "All in One" - instead you'll see only the complementary option in the upgrade menu. As soon as you've purchased the complementary option also (thus "All Ukulele" or "Signal Plus"), your app status is automatically upgraded to "All in One".</p>
            </div>
            <div id="screenshot10" style="clear:both;  padding:0 3.125%;">
                <p><center><img src="screenshot_13.png" alt="Screenshot Pro Version" class="img" /></center></p>
            </div>
            <div id="content6" style="clear:both;  padding:0 3.125%;">
                <p>In the screenshot above, you can see the following scenario: the user has already purchased the option "All Ukulele" - thus the only remaining option is "Signal Plus". If he could buy "All in One" also, the total price would exceed the price he would pay for "Signal Plus". </p>
            </div>
            <div id="content7" style="clear:both;  padding:0 3.125%;">
                <h2>Important</h2>
                <p>The In-App purchase menu is directly loaded from the App Store, thus you need an Internet connection. If the connection is too slow, it may occur that the In-App purchase options are not completely loaded when you call the settings menu - in such case, the shopping cart symbols are marked as inactive - see screenshot below. It makes sense to call the settings menu again some seconds later.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="screenshot11" style="clear:both;  padding:0 3.125%;">
                <p><center><img src="screenshot_14.png" alt="Screenshot Pro Version" class="img" /></center></p>
            </div><br/>
            <div id="content8" style="clear:both;  padding:0 3.125%;">
                <h2>Restore</h2>
                <p>In order to maintain access to content you’ve already purchased (for example, when you upgrade to a new device, you don’t want to lose all of the items you purchased on the old device), there is a restore button at the bottom of the settings menu. Tapping the restore button, the restore process is initiated - and you get back immediately all features you purchased previously.</p>
