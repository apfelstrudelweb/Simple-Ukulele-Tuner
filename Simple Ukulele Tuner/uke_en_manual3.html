                <p>A standard 4-string ukulele (soprano with standard tuning) has fixed preset frequencies - these are: <br />
                <br />
                - <strong style="color:#00CCFF">G</strong> string: 392.0 Hz,<br />

                - <strong style="color:#00CCFF">E</strong> string: 329.6 Hz,<br />
                - <strong style="color:#00CCFF">A</strong> string: 440.0 Hz.</p>

                <p>By the way, there are other ukulele types with different tunings - please have a look at the configuration menu: you'll find a large list which enables you to set the ukulele type and the ukulele tuning as well - see screenshot below.</p>

                    <li>Direct reading of frequency (including up / down deviations): This method is recommended for advanced musicians who want to tune their instruments to an exact point (after the comma). Once a sound (for example, the A string - 440.0 Hz) has been detected, the deviation from the desired frequency is displayed. </li>
                    <li>LEDs / rectangular buttons: both element types are for guidance only - the more precisely the right note was struck, the stronger the corresponding elements will shine.</li>
                    <li>LED gauge: indicates how much you have to tune up or down. In the above screenshot, you ukulele is nearly in tune (green LED), but you have to tune down slightly until the red LED disappears! </li>
                    <li>Sound indicator (meter): here all the possible notes (and semitones) are displayed - and you can see very clearly how far you are from the reference tone (e.g. A string). If the red vertical line is on the left side of the reference tone, the string must be attuned higher - otherwise lower. Once the display is green, the string is in tune. If you want to know it exactly, you can still (see 1.) get an accurate frequency reading afterwards and, if necessary, perform fine tuning. In addition to that, point 3 is valid for many instruments - not only for ukulele. It is quite possible to attune even on semitones!</li>
